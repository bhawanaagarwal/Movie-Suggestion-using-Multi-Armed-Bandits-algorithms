# Movie Suggestion using various Multi-Armed Bandits algorithms

When a user watches the movie, either they like it or they don't like it. This notebook experiments various algorithms to recommend a movie based on user choice, and explains which algorithm is better.

In this experiment, we considered 13 basic genre of the movie as the arms in bandit - "Action, Crime, Drama, Fantasy, Horror, Comedy, Romance, Science Fiction, Sports, Thriller, Mystery, War, and Western"

The algorithms used in this notebook are - Thompson Sampling, e-greedy, UBC, and random sampling.
